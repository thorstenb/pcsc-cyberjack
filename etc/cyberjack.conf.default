# Version: 3.99.5final.SP12
# This file modifies the behaviour of the Cyberjack driver.
# Please copy this file to the same folder but under the name "cyberjack.conf"
# (i.e. without the trailing ".default").
#

#
# Possible values are:
#  0x00001 Generic debug logging
#  0x00002 Reader debug logging
#  0x00004 CTAPI debug logging
#  0x00008 AUSB debug logging
#  0x00010 CJPPA debug logging
#  0x00020 ECOM debug logging
#  0x00040 transfer debug logging
#  0x00080 USB debug logging
#  0x00100 IFD debug logging

#  0x10000 don't beep
#  0x20000 use the kernel module for old Cyberjacks/Ecoms
#  0x40000 enable the INPUT command (->security risk!)
#  0x80000 don't use X11 for beeping (always use console)
#
# These values can be OR combined to form the resulting value.
#


# When using Moneyplex with Kernel 2.6.13 or before (e.g. SuSE10.0) on a
# 64 bit system you must use the kernel module for the cyberjack/ecom:
#
#  flags=0x20000
# 
# Debug logging can be enabled on such a system with the following setting:
#
#  flags=0x2ffff
#

flags=0

#
# Path and name of the default logfile (defaults to /tmp/cj.log)
#
debugFile=/tmp/cj.log

#
# This file is used to store the serial numbers of the connected devices
# It can be used to assign a reader to a particular port number, regardless
# of the USB port the reader actually is connected to.
# If you call CT_init() with port 0x9000 then the first serial number is read 
# from this file and the USB bus is scanned for a reader with this particular 
# serial number.
# Port 0x9001 indicates the seconds serial number and so forth.
#
# Normally this setting is left blank which makes the driver read and write
# the file from/to the home directory of the calling user (the filename is
# then $HOME/cyberjack_serials).
#
#serialFile=/etc/cyberjack_serials
